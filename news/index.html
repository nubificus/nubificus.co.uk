<a href="https://youtu.be/2pNo8F3AMrw?t=10654">presentation</a> at <a href=https://oideurope2024.openinfra.dev/hungary/>OpenInfra Days
Hungary</a>, in Budapest, earlier
this June, highlighting the innovative capabilities of the <a href=https://katacontainers.io>Kata
Containers</a> project. The talk focused on the
project&rsquo;s advancements, particularly the introduction and maturity of the Rust
runtimes, alongside the go version of the runtime, and demonstrated how the
Kata team is leveraging these technologies to enhance the performance and
security of serverless workloads. As a first time Architecture Committee member
since April 2024, Dr Nanos presented the current status of the project, and how
the team at Nubificus &amp; Nubis is using kata-containers to sandbox serverless
workloads, while exposing hardware acceleration capabilities by integrating
vAccel to the container runtime.</p><h5 id=key-highlights-of-the-presentation>Key Highlights of the Presentation</h5><figure><img src=/images/oidh-photo2.png#center height=180px alt style=floatright></figure><p><em>Kata Containers Project Overview</em>: Dr Nanos began by providing an overview of
the Kata Containers project, an open-source initiative that integrates
lightweight virtual machines (VMs) to enhance the security and isolation of
containerized applications. He explained how Kata Containers combine the speed
and flexibility of containers with the robust security features of VMs, making
them an ideal solution for modern cloud-native applications.</p><figure><img src=/images/oidh-photo1.jpg#floatleft height=180px alt style=floatleft></figure><p><em>Go and Rust Runtimes</em>: A significant portion of the presentation was dedicated
to the dual support for Go and Rust runtimes within Kata Containers. Dr Nanos
detailed the journey from the initial Go runtime to the introduction of the
Rust runtime, emphasizing the performance and safety benefits of Rust. He
discussed the efforts to achieve feature parity between the two runtimes,
enabling users to choose the runtime that best suits their needs without
sacrificing functionality or performance.</p><p><em>Sandboxing Serverless Workloads</em>: Dr Nanos illustrated how Kata Containers are
being used to <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3642977.3652096>sandbox serverless
workloads</a>, a growing trend in
cloud computing. He explained that by using Kata Containers, the team can
provide strong isolation for serverless functions, ensuring that workloads are
securely sandboxed and isolated from one another. This approach not only
enhances security but also improves the reliability and stability of serverless
environments.</p><figure><img src=/images/vaccel-logo_draft.svg#floatright width=180px alt style=floatleft></figure><p><em>vAccel Integration</em>: One of the standout points of the talk was the
integration of <a href=https://docs.vaccel.org>vAccel</a> with Kata Containers. Dr Nanos
explained how vAccel allows the exposure of hardware acceleration
functionalities to sandboxed containers, significantly boosting the performance
of compute-intensive tasks. This integration enables developers to take full
advantage of hardware acceleration within a secure and isolated environment,
paving the way for more efficient and powerful applications.</p><p><em>Looking Ahead</em>: Dr Nanos concluded his presentation with a look ahead to the
future of Kata Containers, including the anticipated release of <a href=https://github.com/orgs/kata-containers/projects/43>Kata
Containers 4.0</a>. He
highlighted ongoing efforts to further unify the Go and Rust runtimes and to
expand the project’s capabilities to meet the evolving needs of the
cloud-native ecosystem.</p><p>The presentation at OpenInfra days Hungary underscored the Kata Containers
project&rsquo;s commitment to innovation and security in containerized environments.

Our team was there presenting
our work around unikernels, and their interaction with the cloud-native world.</p><p>The first presentation took place in the Containers devroom, where we described
the challenges of securing containers within VM or microVM sandboxes and the
complexities of resource optimization on physical nodes. We presented <code>urunc</code>, a
CRI-compatible container runtime spawning unikernels packaged in OCI images.
The talk highlighted <code>urunc</code>&rsquo;s internals, covering hypervisor support, network
and storage handling, and integration with high-level orchestration frameworks
like Kubernetes, while also addressing network setup implications when
combining unikernels and generic containers in a k8s context.</p><p>In the Microkernel devroom, we continued our exploration of unikernels
with a focus on modularity. The team presented <code>bunny</code>, a novel build system
aimed at simplifying the Unikernel building process. <code>bunny</code> adopts a layered
approach, making use of the modular aspect of Unikernels. Each component
represents a distinct layer, eliminating the need for users to manually build
dependencies. This approach allows for the creation of minimal and specialized
Unikernel images tailored for individual applications.</p><p>These presentations highlight our commitment to simplify and optimize
application delivery in diverse, heterogeneous infrastructure, providing
valuable insights into security and system optimization in the evolving
landscape of container technology.</p><p>Find below the slides and video recordings of the presentations, along with links to the devrooms full schedule.</p><ul><li>A Modular Approach to Effortless and Dependency-Aware Unikernel Building, Microkernel and Component-based OS devroom <a href=https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3456-a-modular-approach-to-effortless-and-dependency-aware-unikernel-building/>session</a> <a href=https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3456-a-modular-approach-to-effortless-and-dependency-aware-unikernel-building/slides/22316/FOSDEM24-bunny_v1_Y1twYme.pdf>slides</a> <a href=https://live.fosdem.org/watch/ud2208>video</a> <a href=https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/microkernel/>devroom</a></li><li>From Containers to Unikernels: Navigating Integration Challenges in Cloud-Native Environments, Containers devroom <a href=https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3402-from-containers-to-unikernels-navigating-integration-challenges-in-cloud-native-environments/>session</a> <a href=https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3402-from-containers-to-unikernels-navigating-integration-challenges-in-cloud-native-environments/slides/22484/FOSDEM24-urunc_8aePu2M.pdf>slides</a> <a href=https://live.fosdem.org/watch/ub2252a>video</a> <a href=https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/containers/>devroom</a></li></ul><p><strong>FOSDEM</strong><figure><img src=/images/FOSDEM_logo.svg.png#floatleft height=230px alt style=border-radius:10px></figure></p><p>FOSDEM stands for &ldquo;Free and Open Source Software Developers&rsquo; European Meeting.&rdquo;
