We had the opportunity to talk about open-source, meet friends, and make new ones!
It was a pleasure for us to present our work on bringing unikernels closer to the cloud-native world! Video Slides
In this session, we went through the options that users have to deploy applications in Cloud &amp;amp; Edge environments. We talked about containers, sandboxed containers, and unikernels, introduced our own container runtime tailored to unikernels, and presented the integration effort we have undertaken to allow unikernels to execute in k8s &amp;amp; Serverless Computing frameworks.</description></item><item><title>Unikraft Hackathon</title><link>/news/news5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/news/news5/</guid><description>We are excited to host a Unikraft Hackathon in Athens, GR!

With a slim design and precise abstractions, vAccel semantically exposes hardware acceleration features to users with little to no knoweldge of software acceleration framework internals.
Serverless computing workflows are now able to enjoy compute-offload mechanisms to provide AI/ML services as functions, triggered thousands or millions of times by events, on-demand, auto-scaling to multiple physical and virtual nodes.</description></item></channel></rss>
