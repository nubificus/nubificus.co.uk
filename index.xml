      <description>Internship title: Deploying ML workflows in the Cloud &amp;amp; at the Edge
The Cloud computing paradigm appears ideal to deploy and manage application execution at scale. In order to support the cloud computing execution model at the Edge, devices need to support virtualization and run a full hypervisor stack. At the same time, hardware acceleration offers a high degree of computational throughput in a very small power envelope for a wide range of application domains.</description>

      <title>vAccel now available on Firecracker</title>

      <description>Today, Nubificus LTD introduced vAccel support on AWS Firecracker, opening the door for enabling hardware acceleration for serverless computing.
With a slim design and precise abstractions, vAccel semantically exposes hardware acceleration features to users with little to no knoweldge of software acceleration framework internals.
Serverless computing workflows are now able to enjoy compute-offload mechanisms to provide AI/ML services as functions, triggered thousands or millions of times by events, on-demand, auto-scaling to multiple physical and virtual nodes.</description>

      <description>Internship title: Explore TF internal operations to be offloaded to a generic transport mechanism
Short description:
Tensorflow supports offloading computations on hardware accelerators (GPUs, TPUs). In order to use an accelerator, a Tensorflow instance currently needs direct access to the relevant hardware. Although this requirement doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent distributed deployments (either by Tensorflow itself or by higher level frameworks like pycharm) in heterogeneous hardware, it limits flexibility of integrating hardware accelerators to virtualized setups where Tensorflow applications are executed, especially when there are latency constraints (ie.</description>
