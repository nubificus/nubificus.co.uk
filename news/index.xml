Specifically, EC&amp;rsquo;s IR identified the Serverless Framework that Nubificus LTD develops as having a high potential for innovation. The lightweight serverless framework for the Edge is being developed as part of the 5G-COMPLETE Horizon 2020-funded project.
The framework to provide Fast, Secure &amp;amp; Efficient Serverless for the Edge was assessed by the IR (https://www.</description></item><item><title>Nubificus LTD enables efficient &amp; secure execution at the edge</title><link>/news/news2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/news/news2/</guid><description>Nubificus LTD participates in the ICT-40-2020 SERRANO Project (H2020 GA No 101017168): Transparent Application Deployment in a Secure, Accelerated and Cognitive Cloud Continuum, which kicked off in January 2021 and will last three years. SERRANO consortium consists of 11 partners from industry and academia. SERRANO investigates the transparent deployment of applications in a secure and accelerated infrastructure of edge, cloud and HPC resources, based on FPGAs, GPUs, Virtual Platforms and Smart NICs, while facilitating their automated and cognitive orchestration.</description></item><item><title>vAccel now available on Firecracker</title><link>/news/news1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2020 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/news/news1/</guid><description>Today, Nubificus LTD introduced vAccel support on AWS Firecracker, opening the door for enabling hardware acceleration for serverless computing.
With a slim design and precise abstractions, vAccel semantically exposes hardware acceleration features to users with little to no knoweldge of software acceleration framework internals.
Serverless computing workflows are now able to enjoy compute-offload mechanisms to provide AI/ML services as functions, triggered thousands or millions of times by events, on-demand, auto-scaling to multiple physical and virtual nodes.</description></item></channel></rss>
